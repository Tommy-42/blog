      <description>Hey !!
I am Tommy, I do like gaming, programming, rugby.
I was born and raised in the South of France but I live and work in Paris now.
I work at Vente Priv√©e a French ecommerce company that pioneered the model of online flash sales. #vptech
My favourite programming languages are Go. I found something in Go that really please me.
You can find me on the Gophers Slack under the id Tommy PAGEARD</description>
