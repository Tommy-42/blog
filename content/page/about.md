Hey !!<br>
I am Tommy, I do like gaming, programming, rugby.<br>
I was born and raised in the South of France but I live and work in Paris now.<br>
I work at [Vente Priv√©e](https://tech.vente-privee.com/) a French ecommerce company that pioneered the model of online flash sales. [#vptech](#)

My favourite programming languages are Go. I found something in Go that really please me.

You can find me on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
